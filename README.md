# Computational Astrophysics Models
## PH30110


Consisted of 3 computational projects.

### Project 1 - python
Computationally modeled N-body systems using the Runge-Kutta method to solve ODEs. This included a 3-body system comprising of Jupiter, Saturn and the Sun, as well as application of the Cash-Karp method to model comet trajectory.

### Project 2 - C
Modelling the isotropic scaterring of 1M photons through an atmosphere following a numerical implementation of Monte Carlo radiative transfer. Generated a rotation matrix to investigate Rayleigh scattering and determine why the sky is blue.

### Project 3 - C
Solving Eulerâ€™s equations to simulate fluid dynamics in different shock tubes, using a vareity of methods. The Lax-Friedrichs method and Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) method. Applying this model to simulate colliding atomic gas clouds in an interstellar medium.
