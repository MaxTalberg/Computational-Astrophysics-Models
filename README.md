## Computational astrophysics.


Consisted of 3 computational projects.

### Project 1 - python
Set up a computational model of a simple, 3-body problem consisting of two objects
orbiting around the centre of mass of the system using ODEs. Modelled these bodys to represent Jupiter, Saturn and the Sun.

### Project 2 - C
Simulating a Monte Carlo scattering model of photons through an atmosphere.

### Project 3 - C
Solving Eulerâ€™s equations to simulate fluid dynamics in different shock tubes, using a vareity of methods. The Lax-Friedrichs method and Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) method. Applying this model to simulate colliding atomic gas clouds in an interstellar medium.
