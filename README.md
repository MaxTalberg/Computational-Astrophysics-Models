## Computational astrophysics.


Consisted of 3 computational projects.

### Project 1 - python
Set up a computational model of a simple, 3-body problem consisting of two objects
orbiting around the centre of mass of the system using ODEs. Modelled these bodys to represent Jupiter, Saturn and the Sun.

### Project 2 - C
Simulating a Monte Carlo scattering model of photons through an atmosphere.

### Project 3
Set up a computational model of a simple, 3-body problem consisting of two objects
orbiting around the centre of mass of the system using ODEs. Modelled these bodys to represent Jupiter, Saturn and the Sun.
